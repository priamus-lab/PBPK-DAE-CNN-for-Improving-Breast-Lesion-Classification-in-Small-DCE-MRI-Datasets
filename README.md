## Abstract
In biomedical image processing, Deep Learning (DL) is increasingly exploited in various forms and for diverse purposes. Despite unprecedented results, the huge number of parameters to learn, which necessitates a substantial number of annotated samples, remains a significant challenge. In medical domains, obtaining high-quality labelled datasets is still a challenging task. In recent years, several works have leveraged data augmentation to face this issue, mostly thanks to the introduction of generative models able to produce artificial samples having the same characteristics as the acquired ones. However, we claim that biological principles must be considered in this process, as all medical imaging techniques exploit one or more physical laws or properties directly associated with the physiological characteristics of the tissues under analysis. A notable example is the Dynamic Contrast Enhanced-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI), in which the kinetic of the contrast agent (CA) highlights both morphological and physiological aspects. In this paper, we introduce a novel generative approach explicitly relying on Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling and on an Intrinsic Deforming Autoencoder (DAE) to implement a physiologically-aware data augmentation strategy. As a case of study, we consider breast DCE-MRI. In particular, we tested our proposal on two private and one public datasets with different acquisition protocols, demonstrating that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of several DL-based lesion classifiers.
