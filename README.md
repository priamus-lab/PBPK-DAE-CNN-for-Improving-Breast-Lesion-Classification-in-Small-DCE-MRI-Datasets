This is the repository for the paper A Physiological-Informed Generative Model for Improving Breast Lesion Classification in Small DCE-MRI Datasets

## Abstract
In biomedical image processing, Deep Learning (DL) is increasingly exploited in various forms and for diverse purposes. Despite unprecedented results, the huge number of parameters to learn, which necessitates a substantial number of annotated samples, remains a significant challenge. In medical domains, obtaining high-quality labelled datasets is still a challenging task. In recent years, several works have leveraged data augmentation to face this issue, mostly thanks to the introduction of generative models able to produce artificial samples having the same characteristics as the acquired ones. However, we claim that biological principles must be considered in this process, as all medical imaging techniques exploit one or more physical laws or properties directly associated with the physiological characteristics of the tissues under analysis. A notable example is the Dynamic Contrast Enhanced-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI), in which the kinetic of the contrast agent (CA) highlights both morphological and physiological aspects. In this paper, we introduce a novel generative approach explicitly relying on Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling and on an Intrinsic Deforming Autoencoder (DAE) to implement a physiologically-aware data augmentation strategy. As a case of study, we consider breast DCE-MRI. In particular, we tested our proposal on two private and one public datasets with different acquisition protocols, demonstrating that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of several DL-based lesion classifiers.

## Dataset

In this paper, we use two private breast DCE-MRI datasets, with different protocols, provided by "Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Fondazione G. Pascale" of Naples.
To evaluate the generalization ability of the proposed methodology, we also utilized the Advanced-MRI-Breast-Lesions study[1] (Dataset AMBL), a publicly available dataset comprising 632 breast MRI imaging sessions acquired on a 1.5 T MR system between 2018 and 2021. Supporting data for 200 patients, including patient age, lesion location, malignant/benign status, pathology and grade, receptor status, and KI67, were collected from clinical notes, radiology and pathology reports. A certified radiologist with 23 years of experience manually delineated all enhancing or suspicious areas mentioned in the radiological reports. These delineated regions were then automatically thresholded, retaining pixels where the intensity in the first or second subtracted images (created by subtracting the pre-contrast image from the first or second post-contrast image) exceeded a threshold of 75. However, the lesion segmentation mask is available for only 99 patients. The uniqueness of this dataset lies in its inclusion of the standard protocol series (a T1-weighted DCE sequence with five time points—one pre-contrast and four post-contrast, with an acquisition time of 85 seconds—and T2-weighted MRI with and without fat suppression), alongside delayed contrast T1-images taken 20-28 minutes post-contrast administration, as well as the calculated treatment response assessment maps (TRAMs). The Dataset AMBL presents 83 malignant and 82 benign lesions detailed in 12 (i.e. invasive ductal carcinoma, infiltrating lobular carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ, metaplastic carcinoma, liposarcoma) and 13 (i.e. fibroadenoma, fibrocystic dysplasia, inflammatory cyst, fibrotic breast tissue) subtypes respectively.
